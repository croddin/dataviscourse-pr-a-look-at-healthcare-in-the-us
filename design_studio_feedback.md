Group Feedback with Angela Wang (also in her group but not present: Ryan Viertel, Sri Vathsava Nelaturi)

We said that the target audience of our visualization was the general public.
Our feedback was that this does seem like it would be interesting to the general public.
Angela said she would be interested to click through and see correlations.

She said that some of our optional features should probably be mandatory features. The scope might be too small without them. We agreed with this and plan to do all of our "optional" features or substitute features of similar scope. We also plan to add additional views.

The group feedback for how well our project would scale was that it could scale to handle county or hospital data, it could scale well to different data.

Our feedback group like the above/below average scale for our data.
It was decided that our primary encodings are: geospatial, position, color. These are sensible representations for the data.

Some feedback that we got for interaction was that we should animate transitions on the scatterplot. When the user hovers over dots, more information should appear.
Also when the user selects states in the map, highlight in the scatterplot. We plan to implement these features.
